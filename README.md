# Campus Food Delivery System

## Problem Statement
Inefficient and inconvenient food delivery systems on campus are resulting in prolonged
wait times, disorganized processes, and dissatisfaction among students and staff. Despite
the increasing demand for food delivery services within the campus community, the current
system fails to streamline the ordering, preparation, and delivery processes effectively. This
inefficiency not only affects customer satisfaction but also impacts the revenue potential for
campus dining establishments. There is a pressing need to develop a robust and user-friendly
campus food delivery system that addresses these challenges, enhances operational efficiency,
reduces wait times, and ultimately improves the overall dining experience for students and
staff. This document presents an efficient end-to-end application for food delivery system
running within campus

## High Level Design
Food delivery system can be devided into four major components:
1. Customer’s Application
2. Restaurant’s Application
3. Admin Panel
### 4.1 Customer’s Application
The customer application will include the following functionalities:
1. Selection of current location and restaurants from location
2. Searching menu: Allow users to search for different restaurants, cafes etc by location
and cuisines. Users can go through the menus and choose an item from the menu.
3. Order placement: The user can place an order of selected dishes and food with just a
few simple taps on the screen.
4. Ratings: Allow users to provide review for their experience of the restaurant
### 4.2 Restaurant’s Application
The restaurant’s application will have the following functionalities:
1. Order Tracking: Process incoming orders from customer’s
2. User Rating Tracking: Check the user feedback and ratings given to the restaurant
### 4.3 Admin Panel
The Admin Panel will include the following:
1. Add/Remove Restaurants: Add/Remove restaurants as per verification from admin
2. Complaint Management: Dashboard to track all complaints and ratings given by users
